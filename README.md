XMouse For Windows
==================

Not actually xmouse...

This tiny script for luajit, turns on, what is known in \*nix world as "*focus follows mouse*"

This feature is actually built-in in Windows, if I'm not mistaken, since XP/2000, maybe earlier. I've been using this (under Windows) for few years already.

Script changes so called "Windows tracking" settings. From my experience it works well. The only application I'm always having problem with is **Visual Studio**, cause the moment it gets the focus, it puts it's window on-top, which deteats whole "*focus follows mouse*" idea :/

You should experiment with "time" according to your needs.

Unfortunatelly, I'm not aware of any way to have BOTH:
 * *focus-follows-mouse* and
 * *mouse-follows-focus* (I mean in such a way that the cursor is put in the centre of an app, when you change focus with alt+tab)

at the same time under Windows (without using 3rd party apps)
